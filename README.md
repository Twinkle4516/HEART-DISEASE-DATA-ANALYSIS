# Heart-Disease-Data-Analysis

Heart disease is one of the major causes of death for people in in united states. Some disturbing facts about heart disease is,
• A single person goes through death every 36 seconds in united states from cardiovascular diseases or heart diseases that accounts for 6,55,000 deaths every year and that totally counts for 1 in every 4 deaths which is actually a very big reason for deaths in the country.
• The cost spent on united states on heart and cardiovascular disease is close to 219 billion dollars from 2014 to 2015, although the number of deaths saw a drastic change of number to 3,75,980 in 2017.
So, my analysis has been made on the following issues and after careful consideration the project it has been divided into 4 categories for complete analysis and prediction of this deadly disease. Below are the 4 categories:

1. Introduction to Business problem:
Determining the presence of heart disease in people with the help of predictive analytics.

2. Diagnosis:
For performing on the diagnosis, I have created EDA on the heart disease dataset and a thorough analysis provided the insights of the dataset.

3. Predictive Models:
Model to use after performing the EDA we need to find out that what kind of different models to be used and even check the accuracy for the following.

4. Future scope:
After careful consideration of EDA and predictive models we need to check what are the observations and how we can improve them in near future applications.
